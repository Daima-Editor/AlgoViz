# Minimum Spanning Tree

A minimum spanning tree is a special kind of tree that minimizes the lengths (or “weights”) of the edges of the tree.
The minimum spanning tree from a graph is found using the following algorithms:
* Prim's Algorithm 
* Kruskal's Algorithm 

## Prim's Algorithm 
Prim's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which form a tree that includes every vertex
has the minimum sum of weights among all the trees that can be formed from the graph
